### Adding a name attribute at the start of the app

Navigate to db/migrate and open the ```CREATION_DATE_devise_create_users.rb``` file and add ```t.string :name, null: false, default: ""``` inside the create_table method.


Now run the commands to drop and create the database, and run migrations.

```
rails db:drop
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```


To be able to send an extra attribute, so the Devise controller would accept it, weâ€™ve to do some changes at the controller level. We can do changes to Devise controllers in few different ways. We can use devise generator and generate controllers. Or we can create a new file, specify the controller and the methods that we want to modify. Both ways are good. We are going to use the latter one.

Navigate to **app/controllers** and create a new file ```registrations_controller.rb```. Add the following code to the file:

```ruby

class RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController

  private

  def sign_up_params
    params.require(:user).permit( :name, 
                                  :email, 
                                  :password, 
                                  :password_confirmation)
  end

  def account_update_params
    params.require(:user).permit( :name, 
                                  :email, 
                                  :password, 
                                  :password_confirmation, 
                                  :current_password)
  end
end

```


This code overwrites the sign_up_params and account_update_params methods to accept the ```:name``` attribute. As you see, those methods are in the Devise ```RegistrationsController```, so we specified it and altered its methods. Now inside our routes we have to specify this controller, so these methods could be overwritten. Inside ```routes.rb``` change devise to:

```
devise_for :users, :controllers => {:registrations => "registrations"}
```


Open ```app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb``` and change form_for to:

```
<h2>Sign up</h2>
<%= bootstrap_form_for(resource, 
                       :as => resource_name, 
                       :url => registration_path(resource_name)) do |f| %>

  <%= f.text_field :name, 
             placeholder: 'username', 
             class: 'form-control' %>
  <%= f.text_field :email, 
             placeholder: 'email', 
             class: 'form-control' %>
  <%= f.password_field :password, 
                       placeholder: 'password', 
                       class: 'form-control' %>
  <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation, 
                       placeholder: 'password confirmation', 
                       class: 'form-control' %>
  <%= f.submit 'Sign up', class: 'btn sign-up-button' %>
<% end %>
```
